# Real-Time Traffic Congestion Detection with YOLOv8s

This project detects and quantifies traffic congestion in real time using a fine-tuned YOLOv8s model. It includes training, evaluation, and congestion scoring logic.

## üì¶ Required Libraries

Ensure the following versions (or higher) are installed:

- `ultralytics==8.3.123`
- `torch==2.6.0`
- `opencv-python`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`

## üìÇ Dataset

We use the [Street View GDOGO Dataset](https://universe.roboflow.com/fsmvu/street-view-gdogo/dataset/1) from Roboflow.

To use:
1. Visit the link and download the dataset in YOLOv8 format.
2. Place it in a directory like `/data` or update the notebook path accordingly.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1. **Kaggle / Colab (Recommended)**  
   Upload and run the `traffic-detection.ipynb` notebook directly in Kaggle or Google Colab.

2. **Local Setup**  
   Clone this repo and install requirements:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
